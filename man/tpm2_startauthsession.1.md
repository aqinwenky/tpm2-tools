# NAME

**tpm2_startauthsession**(1) - Start a session with the TPM.

# SYNOPSIS

**tpm2_startauthsession** [*OPTIONS*]

# DESCRIPTION

**tpm2_startauthsession**(1) Starts a session with the TPM. The default is
to start a *trial* session unless the **-a** option is specified. It outputs
the session handle in a yaml format to stdout as key value "session-handle"
and the handle in hex (0x1234) format.

# OPTIONS

  * **-a**, **--auth-policy-session**:

    Change the policy session from a *trial* session to a *policy* session.
    **NOTE**: A *trial* session is used when building a policy and a *policy*
    session is used when authenticating with a policy.

  * **-g**, **--policy-digest-alg**=_HASH\_ALGORITHM_:

    The hash algorithm used in computation of the policy digest. Algorithms
    should follow the "formatting standards", see section "Algorithm Specifiers".
    Also, see section "Supported Hash Algorithms" for a list of supported hash
    algorithms.

  * **-S**, **--session**=_SESSION_FILE_:

    Saves the policy session data to a file. This file can then be used in subsequent
    tools that can use a policy file for authorization or policy events. **NOTE**: That
    this will not work with resource managers (RMs) outside of tpm2-abrmd, as most RMs will
    flush session handles when a client disconnects from the IPC channel. This will work
    with direct TPM access, but note that internally this calls a *ContextSave* and a
    *ContextLoad* on the session handle, thus the session **cannot** be saved/loaded
    again.

# EXAMPLES

Start a *trial* session and save the session data to a file.
```
tpm2_startauthsession -S session.dat
session-handle: 0x3000000
```

Start a *policy* session and save the session data to a file.
```
tpm2_startauthsession -S session.dat -a
session-handle: 0x3000000
```

# RETURNS

0 on success or 1 on failure.
